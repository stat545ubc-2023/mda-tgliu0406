## Mini Data Analysis

This repository is a collection of materials and code related to my STAT 545A mini data analysis project.

## About

This repository contains the work I've done until Milestone 2. It includes data, code, and figures related to my analysis.

## Getting Started

_The purpose of milestone 1 is to explore and do initial analysis on a dataset of my choice. For this project, I chose to explore on the "flow_sample" dataset. _

_The purpose of milestone 2 is to further explor the "flow_sample" dataset and dive into 4 research questions that I previously proposed. _ 

To achieve this, the following files have been created and reside within the GitHub repository:
Document name  | Description     
---------------|------------
README.md |a short description of the project
mini-project-1.Rmd | contains the dataset, initial data analysis and research questions
mini-project-1.md | mini-project-1.Rmd knitted into a github-readable markdown file
mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm | contains the figures presented in mini-project-1.md
mini-project-2.Rmd | contains the dataset, initial research questions and the following data manipulation
mini-project-2.md | mini-project-2.Rmd knitted into a github-readable markdown file
mini-project-2_files/figure-gfm | contains the figures presented in mini-project-2.md
