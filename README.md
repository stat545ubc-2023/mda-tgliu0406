## Mini Data Analysis

This repository is a collection of materials and code related to my STAT 545A mini data analysis project.

## About

This repository contains the work I've done until Milestone 1. It includes data, code, and figures related to my analysis.

## Getting Started

_The purpose of this project is to explore and do initial analysis on a dataset of my choice. For this project, I chose to explore on the "flow_sample" dataset. _

Milestone 1 comprises **3** Exercises:
1. Choose a dataset
2. Explorie the chosen dataset
3. Choose research questions

To achieve this, the following files have been created and reside within the GitHub repository:
Document name  | Description

mini-project-1.Rmd | contains the dataset, initial data analysis and research questions

mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm | contains the figures presented in mini-project-1.md
